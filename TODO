These are the list of fixes/features that need to be made.  Contact me
to add to this file.

The requirements are not listed in any particular order

* separate the Sanskrit and Hindi pages.  They are different enough to
merit their own pages.

* write a tool to generate html tables from the consonants and vowels
  hashtables in the language files

* make the letters in the table buttons that when clicked find their
  way into the left box (the one where we type)

  - Suggested by Shailendra Kesarwani

* write an FAQ for the site?

* get the Vowels and Consonants table on the same level
